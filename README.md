CSE 403: AlgoWiz


#Product description

##Major Goals : 
1. 3 main Tiers for learning (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
At Least 1 Algorithm per tier. 
Each tier has its own section which will contain introductory material and a list of prerequisite skills. 
2.Quiz system 
Test understanding of the particular concept.
Each concept in each section has its own section 
On getting the answers correct, we give some positive feedback (great work) and recommended the next steps
On wrong answers, we give some feedback and give hints
3. Interactive visualization of the Algorithms
Visualize the internal workings of each algorithm.
Stepping through the code and letting the user see how to modify/change the output.
4. Development of an interactive web-based platform

##Stretch Goals : 
User Database (Profiles) to keep track of their progress -
Using Google API to setup a user database system to store and update user progress, 
Gamified Point system (reward points) -
A reward system to help motivate studying. Plus adding a leaderboard. 
Data Structures (to learn basics):
Earlier basics such as arrays, linked lists etc.

##Non-functional Requirements

1.Scalability: 
How to handle millions of users?
UI heavy instead  -- lot of users can access the website at once 
This depends on how server heavy our app is and where we are hosting it.
Weâ€™ll start out with a small backend like NoSQL (Google Firebase) that can easily be scaled as required in the future. 
2.Security and Privacy: 
No user data will be gathered.
Stretch goals will utilize OAuth to avoid storing passwords.
3.Usability: 
Targeting people with basic computer science background knowledge (will not be explaining basic structures such as for loops, conditionals etc). 
People who have any experience with some basic CS concepts will easily be able to access and utilize our website. 
Heavy emphasis on user friendly UI. 
Follow W3C Accessibility Standards wherever possible. 

4.Portability and compatibility: Web app (some computer + stable wifi)
 
External Requirements
Stable internet connection -- for lag-free experience
Hosting it on the internet -- no download steps 
Will provide details  on hosting on Filezilla or other hosting services
Will provide details on downloading and setting up packages related to our app.
