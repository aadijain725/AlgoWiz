# AlgoWiz

## Product description
Algowiz is a highly interactive web-based application aimed at spreading the love and knowledge we have for computer science. Initially, it will act as primarily an academic aid to students and teachers alike. It will cover a wide array of topics ranging from sorting and searching algorithms to exploring graphs. The experience will include a separate section for each of the various topics. Each of these sections will have a study guide, a quiz, and a visualizer to help visualize the concepts.

## Major Goals
1. **Lessons** - Organize lessons by topic/category (Sorting Algorithms, Graphs, etc.
At least one lesson per topic with three topics planned for initial release.
Users can visit lessons in any order (there is no locked progession system).
Each lesson contains: 
    * A reading section outlining the concepts.
    * A visual interactive demo.
    * A quiz section with feedback.

2. **Quiz System** - Each lesson contains a quiz section to test or review a users
understanding of the particular concept. Users recieve feedback on both correct 
and incorrect answers as each answer is submitted. Correct answers display encouraging visuals while wrong answers provide hints. Users are not required to 
pass quizzes to procede to other lessons. 

3. **Interactive Demo** - Each lesson contains at least one visual aid to help illustrate concepts. 
Interactive Demos have a simple to understand UI that allows the user to procede or review at their own pace.


4. **Interactive Web Platform** - All these features will be organized and hosted
on a single easy to navigate web based platform designed to be easy to scale and
integrate more content and features.

## Stretch Goals
1. **User Database** - User profiles will allow users to keep track of their progress.
2. **Gamified Point System** - A reward system to motivate studying. 
3. **Online Leaderboard** - Public competition to encourage students to explore the site and attempt more lessons and quizes.
