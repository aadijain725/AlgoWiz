# AlgoWiz

AlgoWiz is a web application to help students study and review computer science concepts via definitions, interactive demos, and quizzes.

## Major Goals : 
1. **Lessons** - Organize lessons by topic/category (Sorting Algorithms, Graphs, etc.
At least one lesson per topic with three topics planned for initial release.
Users can visit lessons in any order (there is no locked progession system).
Each lesson contains: 
    * A reading section outlining the concepts.
    * A visual interactive demo.
    * A quiz section with feedback.

2. **Quiz System** - Each lesson contains a quiz section to test or review a users
understanding of the particular concept. Users recieve feedback on both correct 
and incorrect answers as each answer is submitted. Correct answers display encouraging visuals while wrong answers provide hints. Users are not required to 
pass quizzes to procede to other lessons. 

3. **Interactive Demo** - Each lesson contains at least 1 visual aid to help illustrate concepts. Interactive Demos have a simple to understand UI that allows
the user to procede or review at their own pace. Code demos allow users to 
visualize the internal workings of each algorithm by stepping through the code and letting the user see how to modify/change the output.

4. **Interactive Web Platform** - All these features will be organized and hosted
on a single easy to navigate web based platform designed to be easy to scale and
integrate more content and features.

## Stretch Goals : 
* User Database (Profiles) to allow users to keep track of their progress
* Gamified Point System (reward points) A reward system to help motivate studying. 
* Online Leaderboard to encourage students to explore the site and attempt more 
lessons and quizes.
