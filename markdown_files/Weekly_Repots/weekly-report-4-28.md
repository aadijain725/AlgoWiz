### Next Week's Team Goals
<!-- outline your plans and goals for the following week.

For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week. -->

lesson etc)
* Finish wireframe for Interactive Visualizer
* Finish research on how to implement Visualizer
* Write unit tests for components and look into CI for React
