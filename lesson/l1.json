You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.  All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. You’re disgusting."}

He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?
